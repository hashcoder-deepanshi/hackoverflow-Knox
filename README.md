Problem Statement

The Human Development Index (HDI) was created to emphasize that people and their capabilities should be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a country, not economic growth alone. The HDI can also be used to question national policy choices, asking how two countries with the same level of GNI per capita can end up with different human development outcomes. These contrasts can stimulate debate about government policy priorities.

Track : Geopolitics

HDI Visualizations : 
we have performed visualization and classification on world map which classifies the data into basically 4 categories :

less than 0.550 for low human development,
0.550–0.699 for medium human development,
0.700–0.799 for high human development and
0.800 or greater for very high human development.

Key Features:
1. It is important to achieve universal access to health and education. Without any delays, the national policy should be put into practise, and the quality and dropout rates in public schools should be monitored.
2. Regional differences in development and social indicators, such as infant mortality, literacy, etc., should be reduced. States that are falling behind should encourage investment, especially in industries with high employment rates. Additionally, the central government should offer them performance-based incentives to raise their social indicators.
3. You should also look into the gender pay gap in the workplace. Workplaces need to be made more gender inclusive, along with changing how families view working women and encouraging spouses to help out around the house.
4.The social justice system needs to be improved. Even though Dalits are given preference for employment and college admissions, their representation in higher positions is still insignificant when compared to their overall population. Additionally, it is important to address the discrimination people experience when using public services and in society at large.
